# Introduction

The report begins by highlighting the improvements of **Spring Boot 3.0** over its predecessors. Its new features such as lazy initialization, improved error handling, security enhancements for reactive applications, and increased support for robust API building are notable upgrades from the previous versions.

# GraphQL

**GraphQL**, with its capability to allow clients to specify the details of the required data, is viewed as a significant performance enhancer reducing over-fetching issues. The boost in implementing GraphQL in Spring Boot applications is attributed to the emerging libraries like GraphQL KICKSTART and GraphQL Java Tools. 

# Apache Kafka

**Apache Kafka** has shown increasing compatibility with Spring Boot 3.0, enabling the handling of real-time data pipelines and stream processing applications. Coupled with Spring Boot's easy configuration tools, this has resulted in a shift of focus on Kafka for its scaling and fault-tolerant processing capabilities.

# MongoDB 

Following this, the use of **MongoDB** for high-performance web applications development, in conjunction with GraphQL and Spring Boot 3.0, has been discussed. Noteworthy enhancements such as support for the latest MongoDB driver have been made to boost performance. Advanced features like a fluent API for MongoDB queries and operations and increased support for reactive programming have been made available through tools like Spring Data MongoDB.

# Deployment to AWS 

The report also elaborates on simplified deployment procedures of Spring Boot 3.0 applications on **AWS**, thanks to advanced tools and services. AWS Elastic Beanstalk is reliable for deploying and running Spring Boot 3.0 applications, whereas AWS services like SQS, SNS, and Lambda have enhanced integration capabilities with Spring Boot 3.0 applications.

# Integration of AWS Services 

The contribution of **AWS's** dedicated Maven Wagon in creating and deploying Spring Boot 3.0 applications onto AWS is highlighted, allowing developers to push code directly from their local machines to AWS S3 Buckets, avoiding explicit .jar uploads. The AWS CodeStar service is also commonly used for building, deploying, and managing applications completely from the AWS console.

# Towards Serverless Architectures 

Looking towards the future, the report wraps up by explaining the industry's shift towards serverless architectures. AWS Lambda, when used with Spring Boot 3.0, allows serverless execution, and ventures like Spring Cloud Function support writing Spring applications directly as AWS Lambda functions. 

In conclusion, this holistic overview serves to outline the key aspects one must be aware of when building Spring Boot 3.0 applications with GraphQL, Kafka, and MongoDB and deploying them onto AWS.
